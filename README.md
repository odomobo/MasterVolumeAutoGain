# MasterVolumeAutoGain
A VST plugin which adjusts gain based on the windows master volume. Why would you want this? Normally, you wouldn't. However, it's particularly useful if you're routing your windows audio through some kind of a DAW, and you want the output of that DAW to be scaled based on the windows volume level.
